# guitar-case-sensor

A project to build humidity sensors into guitar cases and to read the humidity without opening the cases.

Eventually this repository will contain the project's microcontroller source code as it is developed. A description of the project along with details of progress can be found on the [Guitar Case Humidity Sensor Project](https://cahamo.delphidabbler.com/projects/guitar-case-sensor/) page of the [Cahamo](https://cahamo.delphidabbler.com) website.
